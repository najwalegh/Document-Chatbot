# GPT-4 & LangChain -ChatGPT Chatbot for Your Documents


Tech stack used includes LangChain, Pinecone, Typescript, Openai, and Next.js. LangChain is a framework that makes it easier to build scalable AI/LLM apps and chatbots. Pinecone is a vectorstore for storing embeddings and your PDF in text to later retrieve similar docs.

## Development

1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP

```
git clone [github https url]
```

2. Install packages

First run `npm install yarn -g` to install yarn globally (if you haven't already).

Then run:

```
yarn install
```

After installation, you should now see a `node_modules` folder.

3. Set up your `.env` file

- Copy `.env.example` into `.env`
  Your `.env` file should look like this:

4. In the `config` folder, replace the `PINECONE_NAME_SPACE` with a `namespace` where you'd like to store your embeddings on Pinecone when you run `npm run ingest`. This namespace will later be used for queries and retrieval.

## Convert your files to embeddings

**This repo can load multiple files**

1. Inside `docs` folder, add your pdf files or folders that contain pdf files.

2. Run the script `yarn run ingest` to 'ingest' and embed your docs. If you run into errors troubleshoot below.

3. Check Pinecone dashboard to verify your namespace and vectors have been added.

## Run the app

Once you've verified that the embeddings and content have been successfully added to your Pinecone, you can run the app `npm run dev` to launch the local dev environment, and then type a question in the chat interface.
